3. Use any route to call the method with a descriptive name relevant to your JSON data. 

Example: If your JSON file is about cars => the URL should be: http://localhost:3000/cars 

 

## JavaScript File3

 pick anyone except “get()” to test it with Postman desktop version 

 Capture the image of running one of the CRUD methods in Postman
